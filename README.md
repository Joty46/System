A system to support the rural women by selling the homemade products through online 
platform. We have designed an android application for the users and a website for the 
admin through which system can be controlled.
There are two types of users: sellers and buyers. 
• For both of them there is registration and login process. We have tried to make registration 
process as easy as possible: scanning national Identity card and giving some additional 
information.
• Both of them will be able to see list of all the products and list of all sellers.
• They can order any of the product. For ordering 40% of the price of the product should be paid in advance 
using bkash application.
Additional features for the seller:
• One can add new product. 
• One can see list of all of his product.
• If any of one’s product is unavailable he can delete that product.
• One can see list of the orders he has received.
• If one has completed any order he can confirm that work has been, then that order will not be 
shown in the list.
