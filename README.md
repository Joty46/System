A system to support the rural women by selling the homemade products through online 
platform. We have designed an android application for the users and a website for the 
admin through which system can be controlled.


There are two types of users: sellers and buyers. 
* For both of them there is registration and login process. We have tried to make registration 
process as easy as possible: scanning national Identity card and giving some additional 
information.
* Both of them will be able to see list of all the products and list of all sellers.
* They can order any of the product. For ordering 40% of the price of the product should be paid in advance 
using bkash application.

Additional features for the seller:
* One can add new product. 
* One can see list of all of his product.
* If any of oneâ€™s product is unavailable he can delete that product.
* One can see list of the orders he has received.
* If one has completed any order he can confirm that work has been, then that order will not be 
shown in the list.


Features of this system:
* Firebase Authentication for login and registration
* Hashing (SHA-256 algorithm) for password encryption
* Image scanning for registration
* SMS OTP verification system
* Bkash app for payment
* All users can see products and artists and place orders
* Only sellers can see order and upload products
* Users can give rating to products
*Customers can add product to their wishlist
